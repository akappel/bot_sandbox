Model description:       "Android # 16"

Androids #16, #17, #18, #19, #20 are out to destroy our heroes on the Earth. Putting Earth 
at peril, these androids have amazing strength and enjoy devastation for its sake. Android 16 
is an experimental model. A big muscled red-haired man, Android 16 is out to destroy whatever 
he sees. The strong, silent type, he doesn't say much, he is simply super strong.

Android #16 is one of the oddest characters in DBZ, and he seems deeper and more complex 
than most characters on the show. Created by Dr. Gero as an experiment, #16 was never 
meant to be activated. Unlike his counterparts, he was not based on a human model and is 
completely mechanical.
